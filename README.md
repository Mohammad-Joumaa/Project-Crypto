# Project-Crypto
SecureChat Protocol is a Python-powered encrypted messaging system that uses a hybrid cryptography approach. It relies on RSA-2048 to securely exchange keys and AES-256 to encrypt messages efficiently. Designed with a client server structure, it provides end to end encrypted communication between multiple users right from the terminal.
